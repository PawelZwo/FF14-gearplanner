## Introduction

As a Final Fantasy XIV player I noticed that every patch I create a new table sheet to make sure that I know, what I
need to buy for my character. I found existing web apps confusing to use; they display informations in (to me) not clear
manner.

My idea was to create a webapp that will in more clear and readable way present a User with ability to create
gearsets.

This is my first full-pledged webapp project.

***

## Installation
Fork this repository and clone it. 
REMEMBER to change local_settings_public.py name to local_settings.py and follow instructions in there to connect to your DB.
To populate your DB with initial data for Job, Race and Cost, use command in the terminal:

```django-admin loaddata fixtures/initial```

## Technologies

The app was created using:

```
* Python 3.11
* Django 4.2.1
* Bootstrap 4
* HTML 5
* JavaScript
```

## Requirements

```
* django-mathfilters 1.0.0
* psycopg2-binary 2.9.6

```

***

## Features

You will be able to:

* view gear pieces for each role,
* add a gear piece (both in admin site and via webapp itself),
* login / logout / registration,
* view races' base stats,
* view list of: jobs, costs, types, contents;
* view, edit and delete (as for now, both editing and deleting is Superuser exclusive) a gearset,
* create a gearset, which will be assigned to your profile,
* view gearsets created by you in Profile.

## To-do

* inserting data into DB from API (as for now each gear piece is added manually by a superuser),
* preventing a User from adding the same ring in both left and right ring slots (not applicable to crafted,
  non-augmented pieces),
* displaying gear pieces filtered by a chosen job in "Add a gearset" form,
* editing a gearset using custom View, not using EditView from Django, to enhance UX.

## Inspiration

Web idea as a whole was inspired by already existing webapps such as [Etro](https://etro.gg/) and similar.

Front-end was inspired by [CoreySchafer](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer)'s Django Tutorial series that can be
watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p).
