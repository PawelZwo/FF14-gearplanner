## Introduction

As a Final Fantasy XIV player I noticed that every patch I create a new table sheet to make sure that I know, what I
need to buy for my character. I found existing web apps confusing to use; they display informations in (to me) not clear
manner.

My idea was to create a webapp that will in more clear and readable way present a User with ability to create
gearsets.

This is my first full-pledged webapp project.

***

## Installation

Fork this repository and clone it.
REMEMBER to change local_settings_public.py name to local_settings.py and follow instructions in there to connect to
your DB.
To populate your DB with initial data for Job, Race and Cost, use commands in the terminal:

```
cd backend
cd core
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/initial
```

## Technologies

The app was created using:

```
* Python 3.11
* Django 5.0a1
* React
* Bootstrap-React
```

## Requirements

```
* Node.js

If using PostgreSQL:
* psycopg2-binary 2.9.6
* PostgreSQL database
```

## Inspiration

Web idea as a whole was inspired by already existing webapps such as [Etro](https://etro.gg/) and similar.
